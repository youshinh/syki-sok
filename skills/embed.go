// Package skills embeds the agent skill (the md-memo folder next to this file) into the program,
// so `md-memo agent install-skill` can put it into an agent's skills folder without the
// repository or the release zip: a Homebrew install, for one, has neither.
//
// The files cost about 320 KB in the binary and nothing at start-up: the data sits in the
// read-only part of the program and is only read when the command runs.
