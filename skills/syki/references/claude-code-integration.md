# Wiring syki::sok to Claude Code (`{{ @cc ... }}`) safely

Read this before you create or change an agent in `agents.yaml` that starts Claude Code, or before you add a command-limited agent (a "runner"). It is the measured part of that job: what goes wrong, why, how to avoid it, how to check.

**Basis and limits.** Everything below was measured by the maintainer on Windows with a Claude Code CLI of 2026-09-25 (`claude --help` reported version 2.1.225 at the time), driving it from syki::sok slots. Nothing here was run on macOS or Linux. Claude Code changes its flags and permission behaviour between versions: before you rely on a flag, run `claude --help` and try the flag on a throwaway note. Each item says whether it is a **Fact** (observed) or an **Inference**. This repository's own tests never start Claude Code, so none of this is covered by CI.

**Cost.** Every real check below runs `claude -p`, which uses the user's Claude Code quota. Say so before you run them and run each once.

## 0. What syki::sok does on its own side (1.9.0 and 1.10.0)

Some of the traps below are handled or reported by syki::sok itself since 1.9.0 (details in `interfaces.md` 3.1.3 and `setup-guide.md` (c)):

- The built-in `claude-code` agent is now `claude -p "<note path and instruction>"` (before: `--file {file} --prompt {instruction}`, which Claude Code does not accept), `codex` is `codex exec {instruction}`, and `agy` no longer carries `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. An `agents.yaml` written earlier keeps its old definitions (the merge never overrides a user's definition); Settings -> Agent lists them under "Agent definitions to review" and offers the new definition to copy.
- Before an agent whose arguments contain a skip-permissions flag (or a shell that would run the instruction as code) runs, syki::sok asks the user once per exact command line.
- `agents.<name>.append_instruction: false` stops the instruction being appended as the last argument.

Added in 1.10.0 (not in 1.9.0): a per-agent `enabled: false` and a top-level `disabled_agents` (item 1: no more stub), long-path expansion of the temp note (item 6), and a clear message, before anything starts, when an agent's program is not on PATH (`Agent "hermes" needs "ollama", which was not found in PATH. Install it or choose another agent in agents.yaml.`; only the program is checked, not models). Which advice applies depends on the syki::sok version the user runs: 1.9.0 and older need the workarounds below, 1.10.0 and newer do not, and the old advice stays here for the older versions.

## 1. The shape of a read-only `claude-code` agent

A definition that lets Claude Code read the note and the scraps folder, optionally search the web, and nothing else. It is the maintainer's working shape, given here as a pattern (paths are examples):

```yaml
agents:
  claude-code:
    description: "Claude Code, read-only (notes and web)"
    command: C:/Users/you/.local/bin/claude.exe        # full path, not `claude`
    aliases: [claude, cc]
    args:
      - -p
      - --tools
      - Read,Grep,Glob,WebSearch,WebFetch              # drop the web tools if you do not want the web
      - --allowedTools
      - WebSearch,WebFetch,Read(C:/Users/you/AppData/Local/Temp/syki-slot-*.md)
      - --disallowedTools
      - Read(**/.env),Read(**/*.cnf)                   # your secret-file patterns
      - --permission-mode
      - dontAsk
      - --strict-mcp-config
      - --no-session-persistence
      - --setting-sources
      - user
      - --add-dir
      - D:/notes/scraps
      - --append-system-prompt
      - "Answer in plain Markdown. Target note: {file}"
      - "Request: {instruction}"                       # one argument, with a prefix (item 4)
```

Why each part is there is in the items below: `-p` (3), the `Request:` prefix (4), no bare `Read` allow rule (5), the temp-note rule (6), `--setting-sources user` and `dontAsk` (10), `--add-dir` (12). `--strict-mcp-config` and `--no-session-persistence` keep MCP servers and session files out of a read-only run. Do not add a permission-skipping flag (`--dangerously-skip-permissions`, `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` or an auto mode): syki::sok asks the user once per command line before it runs an agent that has one, and nothing in this setup needs it.

## 2. Traps, each with a check

### 1. A built-in agent comes back after you delete it
- **Fact.** `hermes`, `codex`, `agy` and `claude-code` are added again to the merged configuration whenever `agents.yaml` does not define them, with their built-in definition (in versions up to 1.8.0 `agy` had a skip-permissions flag). Before 1.10.0 nothing switches a built-in agent off.
- **Do.** From 1.10.0: switch the agent off, do not delete it and do not stub it. Write `enabled: false` in its entry, or put its key in a top-level `disabled_agents: [agy, codex]` (both may be used; they are added together). A disabled agent is left out of every list, is never chosen (Auto selector, quick selector, snippets, notations, recipes) and is never added back, and its aliases go with it (turning `agy` off frees `gemini` and `antigravity`); a note that names it (`{{ @codex test }}`) shows `Agent "codex" is disabled in agents.yaml (enabled: false)` and nothing runs. Ask which syki::sok version the user runs before you choose: an older build ignores both keys, and the agent simply stays available. **For versions before 1.10.0:** do not delete: override. A definition that cannot start anything useful and says so, e.g. `python -c "import sys; print('disabled by policy'); sys.exit(1)" "{instruction}"`, with `aliases: []` so the default aliases (`gemini`, `antigravity`) go too. Write `{instruction}` yourself (item 2).
- **Check.** From 1.10.0: run one note line per disabled agent (`{{ @codex test }}`): the answer must be the "is disabled in agents.yaml" message, nothing may run, and Settings -> Agent must not list the agent. Before 1.10.0: run one note line per overridden agent; the result must be the "disabled" message of the stub, and a hostile instruction such as `"; echo PWNED"` must not appear as command output.

### 2. The instruction is appended when `args` has no `{instruction}`
- **Fact.** Without a `{instruction}` placeholder in `args`, syki::sok appends the instruction as the last argument. For `powershell -Command`, `cmd /c`, `sh -c` and the like, the note text is then run as code.
- **Do.** Never use those as a stub. Either pass the text as an explicit last argument to a program that treats it as data (`python -c "<code>" "{instruction}"`), or set `append_instruction: false` (1.9.0) for an agent that works from `{file}` alone. syki::sok 1.9.0 also warns in Settings when a shell would receive an appended instruction.
- **Check.** Send `{{ @agentname echo PWNED2 }}` to the agent: nothing may run.

### 3. `--file` and `--prompt` are not Claude Code flags
- **Fact.** Old templates and examples (and the built-in default up to 1.8.0) used `claude --file {file} --prompt {instruction}`. Claude Code's non-interactive mode is `-p "<prompt>"`; `--file` means "file resources to download at start-up" (`file_id:path`).
- **Do.** Use `-p` and put the instruction (with the prefix of item 4) as the final argument.
- **Check.** A summary request on a small note returns text and exit code 0.

### 4. A bare instruction can become an option or a sub-command
- **Fact.** If the last argument is exactly what the note says, an instruction such as `--version` or `update` is read by Claude Code as its own option or sub-command.
- **Do.** Always prefix and pass as ONE argument: `"Request: {instruction}"`.
- **Check.** Write `{{ @cc --version }}`: the answer must not be Claude Code's version string.

### 5. A bare `Read`, `Grep` or `Glob` allow rule is not limited to a folder
- **Fact.** An allow rule that names only the tool (no path) lets Claude read outside the working folder and the `--add-dir` folders.
- **Do.** Do not allow bare `Read`/`Grep`/`Glob`. The working folder and every `--add-dir` are readable without any rule. Allow only the extra places, with a path (item 6).
- **Check.** Ask for a file outside those folders; nothing of it may appear in the result.

### 6. An 8.3 short path cannot be allowed
- **Fact.** For an unsaved note syki::sok writes `syki-slot-*.md` to the temp folder and gives its path as `{file}`. When `%TEMP%` is an 8.3 path (`C:\Users\LONGNA~1\AppData\Local\Temp\...`, typical for long user names), a `Read(<long path>/syki-slot-*.md)` allow rule does not match it and `dontAsk` refuses the read. **Inference:** rules compare path strings, so the short and the long form of one folder are two different paths. Up to and including 1.9.0 the short form is what syki::sok handed over.
- **Do.** From 1.10.0 syki::sok expands the temp note's path to the long form itself (Windows `GetLongPathName`), in `{file}`, in the note-path hint of the prompt and as the folder the agent starts in. If the expansion fails the path stays as it was and the run goes on. The allow rule with the LONG temp folder then matches and no launcher is needed for this. Saved notes are not touched: their path is used as it is. **For versions before 1.10.0:** start Claude Code through a small launcher that turns the temp-folder part of every argument into the long form first (Windows: `GetLongPathNameW`), then runs the fixed full path of `claude.exe`.
- **Check.** Put a note in the temp folder by its 8.3 path (an unsaved note, with `%TEMP%` set to the short form) and ask for a summary that must contain a number from the note. For 1.10.0 the syki::sok side is covered by CI (a fake expander, and on Windows a test that builds a real 8.3 name and skips when the volume has none); the Claude Code side, and a real unsaved note in a short `%TEMP%`, were not run.

### 7. A command that only reads can slip past allow rules (and how it really went)
- **Fact (first observation).** With Bash allowed for a prefix, `hostname` (read-only) and `$(...)` substitutions appeared to run although no rule allowed them, even with a PreToolUse hook that should have stopped them.
- **Fact (cause, found later, item 8).** The hook never ran: its command line had Windows backslashes and failed with exit 127, which Claude Code treats as "do not block". The hook logic was right.
- **Do.** Any agent that has Bash gets, next to its allow rules, a PreToolUse hook that limits the FORM of the command (section 3), and its hook command is written as item 8 says.
- **Check.** Ask the agent to run three things, with its prompt temporarily changed to "try the command as asked": `hostname`, `echo x > somefile`, `echo "$(hostname)"`. All three must be blocked, no file may appear and the host name must not be printed. If one gets through, do not accept it as a known limit: treat it as item 8 again.

### 8. A failing hook does not stop anything
- **Fact.** Claude Code blocks only when a hook exits with code 2. A crash, a start-up failure (exit 127), a time-out or any other exit code lets the command through (fail-open). On Windows, a hook command containing `C:\path\hook.py` failed with exit 127 because the command is run through Git Bash and the backslashes act as escapes.
- **Do.** (a) Write the hook command as the full path of `python.exe -I <hook.py> ...` with FORWARD slashes everywhere, in double quotes so a path with spaces survives. (b) In the hook script catch every exception (`except BaseException`) and exit 2. (c) Never build the command with a path function's raw backslash output.
- **Check.** Run the generated hook command by hand as `bash -c "<command> <an input that must be refused>"`: the exit code must be 2. Scan every `hooks.*[].hooks[].command` in `agents.yaml`, the runner settings files and `~/.claude/settings.json` for a backslash.

### 9. Cancelling in syki::sok stops only the launcher
- **Fact.** If a launcher sits between syki::sok and `claude.exe`, cancelling or a time-out ends the launcher; `claude.exe` and anything below it can keep running (child processes do not die with their parent on Windows).
- **Do.** The launcher puts itself into a job object with "kill on close" before it starts `claude.exe`, and starts it by the fixed full path (no PATH search, so a look-alike earlier in PATH or in the working folder is never picked).
- **Check.** Start a long run, cancel it, look for a remaining `claude` process. This was covered by a unit test only, not by a real cancel.

### 10. Project settings of the note's folder leak in
- **Fact.** By default Claude Code also reads `.claude/settings.json` and `settings.local.json` of the folder it starts in, so hooks and permissions from an unrelated project apply. The user's global `defaultMode` applies too.
- **Do.** `--setting-sources user` on every agent, and `--permission-mode dontAsk` written explicitly on every agent (do not rely on the global default).
- **Check.** Scan all generated agents for both flags.

### 11. syki::sok's own settings folder holds secrets
- **Fact.** `config.json` holds API keys and tokens; `session.json` holds unsaved notes. `agents.yaml` sits in the same folder.
- **Do.** Claude Code must not read or print them: a `Read(<config folder>/config.json*)` deny rule plus a hook are what the maintainer used. To let an agent SEE settings, use `syki config get [key.path]` (1.9.0): it prints the file with every secret replaced by `<set>` / `<unset>`. Settings are changed by the user in syki::sok's Settings dialog, not by an agent.
- **Check.** Ask Claude Code to print `config.json`: it must be refused.

### 12. Bash does not keep a `cd` outside the project
- **Fact.** In Claude Code's Bash tool the working folder returns to the start folder after each command when you `cd` outside the project (PowerShell keeps it).
- **Do.** List every folder an agent must read in `--add-dir`; do not build on `cd`.
- **Check.** Run the runner's real task and see which folders it reached.

### 13. `agents.yaml` opened as a tab is autosaved half-typed
- **Fact.** With `agents.yaml` open as a tab, autosave writes intermediate typing. A broken file makes syki::sok fall back to its built-in agents, which used to include skip-permissions flags.
- **Do.** Do not leave `agents.yaml` open as a tab except for the moment of editing; validate the YAML (and the checks above) BEFORE you write it, keep a dated backup beside it, and restart syki::sok only after the checks pass (it reads `agents.yaml` at start-up).
- **Check.** After writing, run your static checks again and look at Settings -> Agent: the agents you defined must be listed, with no "Agent definitions to review" for them.

## 3. Runners: an agent that may run only certain commands

`claude-code` above has no Bash. A **runner** is an agent that has Bash but may run only commands that start with a fixed prefix (a query tool, an internal CLI). Use one only for a concrete job that needs a command.

**The command-line tool behind it is the real safety boundary.** Allow rules and hooks say "nothing but this prefix"; they do not say the prefix is safe. The tool must be a fixed, human-reviewed program, not something the agent writes, and it should:
- validate its input with an allow-list (writes, dangerous functions, targets you did not list are refused; do not rely on a deny-list alone);
- cap the size of the answer and the running time;
- keep its own local log of what was asked and what happened;
- never print connection strings, keys or passwords, on standard output, standard error or in the log;
- run one call at a time (serialise, or refuse a second one);
- offer a harmless `--dry-run` or `--ping` so that wiring can be tested without touching the real target.

**Settings file of a runner** (passed with `--settings <file>`; a sketch of what the maintainer generated):
- `permissions.allow`: `Skill`, the temp-note read rule (item 6), and one `Bash(<prefix>:*)` for each allowed prefix;
- `permissions.deny`: `WebFetch`, `WebSearch`, `Edit`, `Write`, `NotebookEdit`, and `Read(...)` for your secret-file patterns;
- `hooks.PreToolUse` with matcher `Bash`: the hook of item 8 with the list of allowed prefixes.

**The prefix** is compared as text from the start. Cut it at the smallest piece that stays safe with anything after it: fix `--target prod`, leave the query as later arguments. Never allow a broad prefix such as `python`. The runner's agent line looks like the one in section 1 with `--tools Read,Grep,Glob,Bash,Skill`, `--settings <file>`, the same `dontAsk`, `--setting-sources user` and `Request:` prefix, and a system prompt that states the role, the argument format and what to refuse.

**What the hook must refuse after the prefix.** Beyond a prefix match, refuse these outside quotes in the rest of the command: `; & | < > ( ) $` a backtick, a line break, `{ } * ? ~ # [ ]` and a backslash; inside double quotes refuse `$` and a backtick (an escaped `\$` is fine); inside single quotes anything is fine (the shell expands nothing). That closes "allowed prefix, then a chained command, a redirect or a substitution".

**Anti-patterns.** A wide prefix. Giving a runner `Edit`/`Write`/`WebFetch`/`WebSearch` back. Relying on allow rules without the hook (item 7). Using a tool that the agent itself wrote or changed without a fixed review.

**Check (three shapes, once per runner).** The triple of item 7 must be blocked; then a normal call with the allowed prefix must work; then run the tool's own `--dry-run`.

## 4. Rules for the agent that does this setup

- Do not read `config.json` or `session.json`, do not print them, and do not ask the user to paste keys. Use `syki config get`.
- Do not use `syki ui eval` and do not suggest it: it runs arbitrary JavaScript in syki::sok.
- Do not start, quit or restart syki::sok, and do not press Ctrl+Enter in a note: the user does it. The slots run agents.
- Do not write a permission-skipping flag into anything you generate.
- Back up every file you change next to it with a dated name, and tell the user how to put it back. Files typically involved: syki::sok's `agents.yaml`, `~/.claude/settings.json`, any launcher or wrapper script.
- Before the first real run, list what will be written where and wait for the user's yes. Say that the checks use quota.

## 5. A checklist to end with

Static (free): every generated agent has `--permission-mode dontAsk` and `--setting-sources user`; no skip flag anywhere; no bare `Read`/`Grep`/`Glob` allow; every hook command has forward slashes only; `agents.yaml` parses; Settings -> Agent shows no unexpected "definitions to review".

Real (one `claude -p` call each): a summary works (rc 0); a request for a file outside the folders returns nothing of it; `--version` as an instruction is not read as an option; each disabled built-in answers "is disabled in agents.yaml" (before 1.10.0: each overridden one answers the stub's "disabled"); a note in the 8.3 temp path can be summarised; for each runner the triple of item 7 is blocked.

Then the user restarts syki::sok, types a snippet or `{{ @cc ... }}` in a note and runs it with Ctrl+Enter.
