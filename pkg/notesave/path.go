// Package notesave decides whether a note may be written to a path an outside caller named
// (`md-memo buffer save --as`, JSON-RPC buffer.save) and writes it, all-or-nothing.
//
// The caller is not the user at a file dialog, it can be a script or an AI agent, so nothing is
// taken for granted: the path must be absolute and plain (no network or device path, no alternate
// data stream, no reserved name), name a .md / .markdown / .txt file, sit in a folder that already
// exists, and never replace an existing file unless it was asked to. No dialog is ever opened and
// no folder is ever created.
