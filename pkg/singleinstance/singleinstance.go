// Package singleinstance provides the "is another syki::sok already running?" check for the
// platforms that do not have one built into their window layer.
//
// Windows answers this with a named mutex created in window_windows.go and never calls
// Acquire; the stub in singleinstance_stub.go exists purely so this package compiles and
// vets everywhere. On darwin and linux Acquire takes an exclusive, non-blocking flock on a
// lock file under the per-user config directory and keeps the descriptor open for the rest
// of the process's life, so the lock is released by the kernel however the process dies -
// including a crash, where a PID file or a "delete on exit" scheme would leave a stale lock
// behind and make the app permanently unstartable.
