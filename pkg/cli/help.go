Usage:
  syki                              Start syki::sok, or bring the running window to the front
  syki <file.md>                    Open a file in a new tab
  <command> | syki [title words]    Append the piped text (max 10 MB) to today's scrap
  syki <command> [options]          Run one of the commands below
  syki help [command]               Show this help, or the help of one command
  syki --help | -h                  Same as help
  syki --version | -v               Print the version

Commands that read and edit the OPEN NOTE (they talk to the running app; start syki::sok first,
otherwise: "Error: syki is not running", exit 1):
  buffer get [--selection] [--tab <id>]      Print the note (or only the selected text)
  buffer get --out <file> [--bom] [--selection] [--tab <id>]
                                             Write the note to a file as UTF-8 and print only
                                             its path, size and hash (no console code page)
  buffer set [--tab <id>] [--expected-hash <h>] [text]
                                             Replace the whole note (--tab: that tab, not on screen)
  buffer append [--tab <id>] [text]          Add text at the end
  buffer replace [--tab <id>] --start L:C --end L:C [--expected-hash <h>] [text]

                                             Write the note to a file: no dialog, only .md .markdown
                                             .txt, never replaces a file unless --overwrite
  tab list                                   List the open tabs (ids, titles, paths)
  tab switch <id>                            Activate a tab (use an id from tab list)

                                             Open a tab (a new note, or an existing file) and print its id
  tab close <id> [--if-saved]                Close a tab; exit 1 and the reason when it stays open

                                             A note as a PDF file (Windows): the app prints its preview
  ui activate                                Bring the window to the front
  ui toggle-split                            Toggle the split view
  ui eval <javascript>                       Run JavaScript in the page (powerful: full control of the UI)

Commands that run on their own (syki::sok need not be running):
  jev verify [--mode m] <command...>         Judge a shell command with the built-in guard
                                             (m: strict | reviewed | unattended)
                                             exit code: 0 safe, 1 blocked, 2 warning
  jev score <command...>                     Expected destructive impact (0 = safe .. 2)
  jev predict [--input <task>] [words...]    Suggest next actions for a task line
  jev dispatch <input...>                    Decide whether to handle it directly or escalate

                                             (reads stdin when --file is not given)
  agent install-skill [--claude | --codex | --dir <path>] [--force] [--link]
                                             Install the agent skill built into this program (works
                                             without the repository, also after a Homebrew install)
  ocr [--json] <imagePath>                   Read the text of an image and append it to today's scrap
  info [--json]                              Where things are: version, config and scrap folders,
                                             today's scrap file, inbox, autosave, app running?
  scrap path [--date YYYY-MM-DD]             Path of a day's scrap file (default today); creates nothing
  scrap list [--from D] [--to D] [--lines]   The daily scrap files (YYYY-MM-DD.md), newest first
  scrap search <text> [--from D] [--to D] [--limit N] [--ranked] [--semantic] [--tag T]
                                             Search the scraps; every hit names its nearest heading
                                             (--ranked: notes that hold the words, best first;
                                             --semantic: notes close in meaning, see scrap index;
                                             --tag: only notes with all of these tags, see scrap tags)
  scrap tags [--json|--text]                 The tags written in the notes (<!-- tags: a, b -->) and
                                             how often each is used; creates nothing
  scrap tag add|remove <tags> [<file>] [--line N] [--write] [--json]
  scrap tag show [<file>] [--line N] [--json|--text]
                                             Put a tag into a note or take one out: prints the new
                                             text (a file, or standard input); --write replaces the
                                             file; --line N tags the entry that holds line N, else the
                                             whole note; show lists the tags the note has
  scrap index [--status] [--rebuild] [--dry-run]
                                             Build or update the semantic index (experimental; off
                                             unless semantic.enabled is set in config.json)
  config get [<key.path>] [--json]           Show config.json with every API key, token and password
                                             hidden (safe to run and to show to an agent)
  lessons list [--agent <key>] [--json|--text]
                                             The lessons kept for agents (rules a person approved after
                                             a failed run): per agent how many rules, how many a run
                                             gets; read-only, creates nothing
  --headless <jev|agent|ocr|info|scrap|config|lessons ...>
                                             Same commands with an explicit "no GUI" marker

Output and exit codes:
  Text at a terminal; JSON when stdout is piped or redirected. --json or --text overrides.
  Exit code 0 = success, 1 = error (message on stderr as "Error: ..."). jev verify: see above.
  buffer flags come BEFORE the text: syki buffer append --tab 2 "- [ ] task".
  (info, scrap, config, lessons, buffer save and tab new / close take their flags before or after their words.)
  Put -- before text that starts with a dash, e.g. syki jev verify -- -rf.
  Text may also come from stdin: echo "more" | syki buffer append
  Windows scripts, agents and CI: syki.exe is a windowed program, so PowerShell and cmd do not wait
  for it and may lose its exit code and output. syki-cli.exe (next to it in the zip) runs every
  command above as a console program and never starts the app; use it there.

Safe editing of the open note (optimistic lock):
  syki buffer get --json                              keep "hash" from the result
  syki buffer set --expected-hash <hash> "<new text>" refused with "conflict" if the note changed meanwhile
  On a conflict, read again and redo the edit. Never drop --expected-hash to make it work.

             scrap.tag_edit {text, op: add|remove|show, scope?: note|entry, line?, tags?, return_text?}   works out how a note's tags

                  new_lines); return_text adds "text", the whole new text. scope entry needs line. tags: "a, b" or ["a","b"] (at most 8).
                  A tag under a heading also applies to the smaller headings below it (# to ###): range_start..range_end is that

                  range_end, descendants, tags}), and message_code on_parent (parent_heading, parent_line) says a tag to remove comes
                  from such a heading: ask again with that heading's line
             scrap.open {date?, background?}   opens that day's file in a tab

             filter.validate {command}  filter.run {command, input?, confirm_warning?, timeout_ms?}   a shell command over some text,
                  through the command bar's guard: a blocked command is refused, a warned one needs confirm_warning
             print.pdf {out, tab_id?, paper?, landscape?, margin?, scale?, pages?, header_footer?, overwrite?}   (Windows)
                  a note as a PDF file: out is an absolute path ending in .pdf, in a folder that exists, never replaced
                  unless overwrite; shows the tab's preview for the print and puts the view back; answers in 8 s at most
                  -> {path, bytes, pages, tab_id}
             deepsearch.plan {query, limit?}   a dry run of a deep search: which notes (rel, label, lines, chars), the sizes, and where the
                  excerpts would go (destination: this PC, or a host and whether it is allowed); sends nothing, keeps nothing. The deep
                  search itself is the person's to run (ui.open_panel scraps_search, mode meaning)
             lessons.list {agent?}   the rules kept for agents (a person approved them after a failed run; they go in front of the agent's
                  instruction): with agent (a key or an alias) {agent, path, exists, count, applied, skipped, disabled}, without it a list
                  of those for every file in the lessons folder. Read-only: no method writes a rule, or an agent could rewrite its own
                  instructions
             The buffer writes act on tab_id (an id from tab.list) WITHOUT showing that tab; without
             tab_id, on the active tab of the primary pane. Their result has tab_id, hash and

Reads and edits the note that is open in the RUNNING app (start syki::sok first).

  buffer get [--selection] [--tab <id>] [--json|--text]
      Print the note. --selection prints only the selected text (error "no active selection"
      when nothing is selected). JSON: {tab_id, content, hash, generation, length, line_count, ...}.
  buffer get --out <file> [--bom] [--selection] [--tab <id>] [--json|--text]
      Write the note to <file> instead of printing it, and print only what was written:
      JSON {path, bytes, hash, generation?}, or one line of text at a terminal. This process
      writes the file itself as UTF-8 WITHOUT a byte order mark (--bom adds one), so Japanese and
      other non-ASCII text arrives intact; a pipe through a shell does not promise that (Windows
      PowerShell 5.1 re-encodes piped text with the console code page). The text is written
      exactly as buffer get would print it. The path is taken relative to the current folder,
      the folder must already exist, a directory is refused, an existing file is replaced in
      one step. --selection writes only the selected text (hash is then the hash of that text).
      hash is the one buffer set --expected-hash expects.
  buffer set [--tab <id>] [--expected-hash <h>] [--expected-gen <n>] [text]
      Replace the whole note. With --expected-hash the write is refused ("conflict") when the
      note changed since you read it: read with buffer get --json, keep hash, write back.
  buffer append [--tab <id>] [text]
      Add text at the end of the note.
  buffer replace [--tab <id>] --start L:C --end L:C [--expected-hash <h>] [text]
      Replace the range from L:C to L:C (1-based line and column). Both default to 1:1, so
      omitting --end INSERTS at the start of the note.
  buffer replace-selection [text]
      Replace the selected text ("no active selection" when there is none).
  buffer save [--tab <id>] [--as <file>] [--encoding utf-8|sjis] [--overwrite] [--json|--text]
      Write the note to a file and bind the tab to it (later autosaves go there). Never opens a
      dialog, never creates a folder. --as is taken from the current folder if relative; without
      it the tab's own file is written (a tab with no file: error "tab has no file"). Only .md,
      .markdown and .txt; no network (UNC) paths, no Windows device names, no ":" streams. An
      existing file is refused ("refused overwrite") unless --overwrite, except the tab's own
      file. --encoding: utf-8 (default; a tab already bound to a file keeps its encoding) or sjis
      (also shift_jis, shift-jis, cp932): a character Shift_JIS cannot hold is an error that lists
      where, nothing is replaced with "?". No BOM; line endings stay LF. JSON: {tab_id, path,
      bytes, hash, encoding, created}; text: "Saved <path> (<n> bytes)". Flags may follow words.
      If the note is edited during the save the file is written, the tab is NOT bound, and the
      error says so ("conflict").

--tab <id> (set, append, replace, get, save) names a tab from tab list. The writes change that
tab WITHOUT making it the active one, taking the focus or moving the user's caret; a tab that is
not on screen has no undo history (the result's previous_hash lets you check what it was). An
unknown id is an error ("no such tab"). get --selection and replace-selection act on the tab shown
in the focused pane: a tab that is not shown has no selection.

Text: the words after the flags, joined by single spaces; when there are none, standard input
is read if it is piped. Flags go BEFORE the text; put -- first for text that starts with a dash.
Output: text at a terminal, JSON when piped; --json / --text override. Exit 0 ok, 1 error.
`
	case "tab":
		return `syki tab <list|switch|new|close|pdf> [options]

Works on the RUNNING app (start syki::sok first).

  tab list [--json|--text]     List the open tabs: id, title, path, whether active or modified.
  tab switch <id>              Make a tab the active one. Use an id printed by tab list: an
                               unknown id is an error ("no such tab").
  tab new [--title <t>] [--path <file>] [--background] [--json|--text]
                               Open a tab and print its id (JSON: {id, title, path, existing}).
                               Without --path it is a new note (fill it with buffer set --tab <id>);
                               with --path (relative to the current folder) an existing file is
                               read like a file opened from Explorer, and a file that is already
                               open is NOT opened twice: the existing tab's id comes back
                               ("existing": true). --background: the tab appears but is not
                               selected, nothing on screen moves. No text is read from stdin.
  tab close <id> [--if-saved] [--json|--text]
                               Close a tab. Exit 0 and "Closed <id>" only when it is closed.
                               A clean tab closes. A tab with unsaved changes gets the save prompt
                               in the window and the command does NOT wait: exit 1, reason "prompt".
                               With --if-saved nothing is ever asked: the tab closes only when it is
                               bound to a file whose current content equals the tab's text (line
                               endings ignored), otherwise exit 1, reason "unsaved" (a tab with no
                               file is never closed this way). JSON: {closed, reason?}.
                               An unknown id is an error. Flags may follow the id.
  tab pdf [<file>] [-o|--out <file.pdf>] [--tab <id>] [--paper a4|a3|b5|letter] [--landscape]
          [--margin normal|narrow] [--scale N] [--pages 1-3,5] [--header-footer] [--overwrite] [--json|--text]
                               Save a note as a PDF, made by the running app from its preview (white
                               paper, black text, pictures in colour, diagrams light, nothing cut):
                               the same as Save as PDF in the print panel. Which note: <file> (opened
                               in a background tab for the print and closed again; a file that was
                               already open is left open), --tab <id>, or the active tab. --out is
                               required unless <file> is given (then the PDF goes next to it, as
                               <name>.pdf). Never replaces a PDF unless --overwrite. Margin: normal
                               is 20 mm, narrow 10 mm. --header-footer: the file's name above, its
                               folder and the page number below (off by default). The view is put
                               back afterwards. Windows only (a Mac: use the print dialog of the
                               preview); a note must be Markdown, and a huge one can take longer
                               than the 8 s the app allows (an error; the file may still appear).
                               JSON: {path, bytes, pages, tab_id}.

Output: text at a terminal, JSON when piped. Exit 0 ok, 1 error (or a tab that stays open).
`
	case "ui":
		return `syki ui <activate|toggle-split|eval> [javascript]

Works on the RUNNING app (start syki::sok first).

  ui activate            Bring the window to the front (also when it is hidden in the tray).
  ui toggle-split        Toggle the split editor.
  ui eval <javascript>   Run JavaScript in the page and print the JSON of the result.
                         Powerful: it can do anything the UI can, so use it only when asked.

Exit 0 ok, 1 error.
`
	case "jev":
		return `syki jev <verify|score|predict|dispatch> [options] <text>

Runs on its own (syki::sok need not be running). Flags: --json, --text, --quiet.

  jev verify [--mode strict|reviewed|unattended] <command...>
      Judge a shell command with the built-in guard, before running it.
      Exit code: 0 safe, 1 blocked, 2 warning (not known to be destructive, cannot be vouched for).
      Fail closed: treat anything but 0 as "do not run".
  jev score <command...>
      Expected destructive impact: score 0 (safe) .. 2 (destructive).
  jev predict [--input <task>] [words...]
      Suggest the next actions for a task line. May use the network when a Jev endpoint or key
      is configured in the environment.
  jev dispatch <input...>
      Decide whether to handle the input directly or escalate it. Same network rule.

Flags go BEFORE the command text; put -- first for a command that starts with a dash.
Output: text at a terminal, JSON when piped; --json / --text override.
`
	case "agent":
		return `syki agent <prune|install-skill> [options]

Runs on its own (syki::sok need not be running).

  agent prune [--query <q>] [--file <path>] [--json]
      Keep only the Markdown sections that match the query words, so a long note fits an
      agent's context. Reads the text from --file, or from stdin when --file is not given (it
      waits if stdin is a terminal). JSON: {original_length, pruned_length, ratio, content}.

  agent install-skill [--claude | --codex | --dir <path>] [--force] [--link] [--json|--text]
      Install the agent skill (SKILL.md and references/, about 320 KB) that is built into this
      program, so an agent such as Claude Code can read it. No repository or zip needed: this is
      the way for a Homebrew install, which does not carry the folder. It does not run
      syki::sok, an agent or the network, and it never reads config.json.
        --claude       Claude Code: ~/.claude/skills/syki, or $CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/skills/syki
                       (the default when no target is given)
        --codex        Codex: $CODEX_HOME/skills/syki, else ~/.codex/skills/syki.
                       UNVERIFIED: that Codex reads skills from there depends on your Codex
                       version; use --dir if it does not.
        --dir <path>   Into <path>/syki (a leading ~ is your home folder)
        --force        Replace what is there even if it was edited, has no marker, comes from a
                       newer syki, or is a link. The lost changes are listed.
        --link         Make syki a link to a skills/syki folder on disk (beside the program,
                       or in the current folder or above: a checkout) so the agent always reads
                       the checkout's text. Not on Windows (links need administrator rights or
                       Developer Mode).
      The copy is made in a temporary sibling folder and renamed into place. A small file,
      .syki-skill-version, records the syki version and a hash of the content. Run again:
      identical content prints "already up to date" (exit 0); an older copy nobody edited is
      replaced; a folder that was edited, or has no marker, is left alone with the differing
      files listed (exit 1) until you pass --force. Prints where it installed. JSON when piped
      ({action, path, version, hash, files, bytes, target, base}); --json / --text override.
      Exit 0 ok, 1 error.
`
	case "ocr":
		return `syki ocr [--json] <imagePath>

Runs on its own (syki::sok need not be running; the Windows Send To menu uses it).

  Reads the text of one image with the cloud vision model from config.json (Windows: the
  on-device engine as a fallback) and APPENDS it to today's scrap. The image may leave the PC.
  Prints "OCR text appended to <note>"; JSON: {text, appended, path}.
  Nothing recognized: "(no text recognized)", nothing written, exit 0.
  Exit 1 with "Error: ..." on stderr when the file cannot be read or the OCR fails.
`
	case "info":
		return `syki info [--json|--text]

Runs on its own (syki::sok need not be running). Reads config.json; creates and changes nothing.
Says where syki::sok keeps things and how it is set up, so nobody has to guess a path.

JSON (piped, or --json), one object:
  version              the app version
  config_dir           the syki-sok settings folder
  config_file          its config.json (may not exist yet: defaults apply)
  scrap_dir            the folder of the daily scraps (config: scraps.scrapDir)
  today_scrap_path     today's scrap file, YYYY-MM-DD.md inside scrap_dir (never created here)
  today_scrap_exists   whether that file exists
  inbox_dir            the hot folder (config: inbox.dir), also when it is switched off
  inbox_enabled        whether the hot folder is watched (config: inbox.enabled)
  autosave             whether open files are saved on their own (config: general.autoSave)
  gui_running          true when a live app answers on the port in ipc-session.json
                       (the file is only read: a stale one is left alone)
No secret is printed: no API key, token, session token or remote URL.
Exit 0 ok, 1 error.
`
	case "scrap":
		return `syki scrap <path|list|search|tags|tag|index> [options]

Runs on its own (syki::sok need not be running). The scrap folder comes from config.json
(scraps.scrapDir; default ~/Documents/syki-sok/scraps). path, list, search and tags create and change
nothing; index writes only the semantic index, which is kept outside the scrap folder; tag writes a
note only when it is given --write.
Dates are YYYY-MM-DD ("Error: invalid date ..." otherwise). Flags may come before or after the
words; put -- before a search text that starts with a dash.

  scrap path [--date YYYY-MM-DD] [--json]
      The path of that day's scrap file (default: today), whether or not it exists yet. It prints
      the bare path even when piped, so $(syki scrap path) works; --json gives {date, path, exists}.
  scrap list [--from YYYY-MM-DD] [--to YYYY-MM-DD] [--lines] [--json|--text]
      The daily files (named YYYY-MM-DD.md) directly inside the folder, newest first; other files
      are not listed. JSON: an array of {date, path, size, modified, lines?}; modified is RFC 3339,
      --lines adds the line count (it reads every file). A missing folder gives an empty list.
  scrap search <text> [--from YYYY-MM-DD] [--to YYYY-MM-DD] [--limit N] [--ranked] [--tag a,b]
              [--semantic [--kind note,log] [--path <pattern>] [--update]] [--json|--text]
      With --ranked: finds NOTES (an entry of a scrap, between two "---" rules or headings) that hold
      the WORDS of the text, on any lines and in any order, best first; "納期 図面" finds a note that
      mentions both. Words are separated by spaces ("quotes" keep a phrase together); in Japanese, a run
      of kanji, katakana or Latin letters is a word and the hiragana particles between them separate
      words. When no note holds every word, the notes that hold at least half of them are listed
      (partial: true). One hit per note: the line with the most words; --limit counts notes. JSON adds
      "ranked": true and, per match, "score" (higher is better) and "partial". Without --ranked:
      Case-insensitive search for the text in every .md file under the folder (sub-folders too,
      folders starting with . skipped): the notes with a day in their name newest day first, then any
      other .md file by path; stopping after --limit matches (default 100). With --from or --to only
      notes whose file name starts with a day inside the range are searched (2026-09-27.md and
      2026-09-27_title.md; a note with no day in its name is never in a range).
      With --tag (repeatable, or a comma separated list, at most 8; leading # and capitals do not
      matter): only notes that have ALL of these tags, whichever kind of search; a tag nobody uses
      gives no matches, not an error. A tag is written in the note as one whole line
      <!-- tags: work, urgent --> (key tags or tag; separated by commas or spaces). Above the first
      heading or --- rule (or in a YAML front matter tags:) it tags the whole file, anywhere else
      the entry that holds it (between two "---" rules or headings) and the smaller headings below it
      (a tag under "# A" is a tag of its "##" and "###" sections too, not of the next "#" or of a
      "---" entry after it); a comment in a code fence, in the middle of a line or over several lines
      is not read. A line that matches is kept when the entry that holds it has the tags; a ranked or
      semantic hit, when its own entry has them.
      JSON: {query, count, truncated, matches: [{file, date?, line, text, heading?, heading_line?}]}.
      file is a full path, line is 1-based, date is set when the file name starts with a day, truncated
      says there were more matches than --limit. heading is the nearest Markdown heading at or
      above the line and heading_line its line number (headings inside code fences do not
      count); text piped in with syki is filed under "## [HH:MM:SS] title". Read the
      surrounding lines with the file path and the line numbers.
      With --semantic (experimental): finds notes close in MEANING to the text, best first, one hit
      per note, from the semantic index (see scrap index); "the idea about sustainable building
      materials" finds a note that never says those words. --from/--to bound the day (notes with a day
      in the file name only), --kind keeps notes or piped logs (note, log; AI results are not indexed), --path keeps
      files whose path inside the scrap folder, or whose name, matches a pattern (sub/*.md).
      Files changed since the index was last updated are not in it: their notes are searched by
      words and fill what is left under --limit; --update first brings the index up to date (at
      most 3 seconds). Without --limit a semantic search shows 10 notes (the word searches 100), and
      notes that score below --cutoff (default 0.85) of the best note's score are left out, "notes"
      saying how many; --cutoff 0 keeps them. (The cut is a share of the best score, never a fixed
      score: a model's scores are not comparable between questions or models, and a score is not a
      percentage to show a person.) When the index is empty or made with another model, or the embedding model
      cannot be reached, the search falls back to the ranked word search and says why in "notes".
      Exit 1 when the feature is off or a cloud host has not been allowed. JSON: the fields above
      plus "semantic": true, "pending" (files not in the index), "left_out" (notes the cut-off
      left out), "notes", and per match "kind"
      (note or log), "end_line", "cosine", "context" (the whole note) and "source" ("semantic",
      or "words" for a file that is not indexed yet).
      Every match of every kind of search also has rel (the file's path inside the scrap folder),
      url (its file:// URL), label (the day and heading) and link ([label](url), ready to paste).
  scrap tags [--json|--text]
      The tags written in the notes and how often they are used, most files first: JSON {tags:
      [{tag, files, entries}], files, undated}. tag is the normalized form (no #, lower case,
      full-width letters made half-width); files counts the notes that carry it anywhere, entries
      the entries it applies to (a tag on the whole file counts all of that file's entries, a tag
      under a heading the entry and the smaller headings below it); files
      is how many .md files were read and undated how many of them have no day in their name (a
      --from/--to range leaves those out). It reads the notes that have a comment or a front matter,
      so ask for it when you need it. Exit 0 even when there is no tag ("tags": []).
  scrap tag add <tags> [<file>] [--line N] [--write] [--json]
  scrap tag remove <tags> [<file>] [--line N] [--write] [--json]
  scrap tag show [<file>] [--line N] [--json|--text]
      Puts a tag into a note, takes one out, or lists the tags the note has. <tags> is one argument,
      a list ("work, urgent"; a leading # is dropped). <file> is a path; without it the text is read
      from standard input (decoded as a pipe is) and --write is an error. Without --line the tag is
      for the whole note; with --line N it is for the entry that holds line N (an entry between two
      "---" rules or headings, the unit of scrap search --tag): a line above the first heading or
      rule, or in a note that has neither, is the whole note after all. A tag is written as a
      one-line comment, <!-- tags: a, b -->, under the entry's heading (at the top of the file for
      the whole note), or added to the first such comment the range already has; a comment left
      without a tag is deleted. A tag that is already there is not written twice: a tag of the
      whole note already applies to every entry of it, and a tag under a heading to every smaller
      heading below it. A tag that an entry only gets from a heading above cannot be taken from the
      entry: use --line of that heading (the answer says which).
      add and remove print the NEW TEXT on standard output, exactly, so > file and pipes work like
      with sed; the note on disk is untouched. --write replaces the file instead (a temporary file
      beside it, then a rename; the file is read again just before and nothing is written when it
      changed meanwhile; it keeps its permission bits, CRLF and byte order mark, is never created,
      and over 16 MB or not valid UTF-8 it is refused) and prints only a summary on standard error.
      Nothing to do (the tag is there, or not) prints the text unchanged and says why on standard
      error, exit 0. Exit 1 when it cannot be done: the note starts with a YAML front matter (a tag for
      the whole note, or a tag that only the front matter has; syki::sok never writes a front matter),
      or the tag belongs to the other range (a tag of the whole note asked for with --line, an
      entry's tag without it, a tag written under a heading above the entry). --json prints the
      edit instead of the text: {changed, scope
      (note|entry, the range used), start_line, end_line, new_lines, eol, line, added, removed,
      unchanged, note_tags, entry_tags, message_code (already, none_found, front_matter,
      front_matter_tag, on_note, on_entry, on_parent or empty), range_start, range_end (the entry
      and everything under its heading), heading, heading_line, descendants, inherited_tags (what
      the headings above give the entry), path (the entry and the headings above it), parent_heading,
      parent_line (for on_parent)}; the lines [start_line, end_line) of the
      old text are replaced by new_lines. show prints the tags of the whole note, and of the entry
      with --line (JSON when piped; the same fields).
  scrap index [--status] [--rebuild] [--dry-run] [--force] [--settle MIN] [--yes] [--json|--text]
      Builds or updates the semantic index of the scrap folder (experimental). Off unless
      config.json has "semantic": {"enabled": true, "model": {"baseUrl": ..., "model": ...}} (for
      example baseUrl http://localhost:11434 and model bge-m3 with Ollama running; a local model
      needs no key). Only the files that changed since the last run are read, and only chunk
      texts that were never embedded are sent to the model, so a run with nothing new costs
      nothing; an interrupted run keeps what it did and goes on the next time. The index lives in
      <settings folder>/index/<id>, never in the scrap folder (the id follows the Git remote of the
      scrap folder, else its path), and can be deleted at any time: it is derived data.
      --status shows the settings, the index and how many files are not in it, and calls no model.
      --dry-run counts what would be embedded and writes nothing. --rebuild makes the index again
      (needed when the model or the chunking changed; the old one is used until the new one is
      done). --force reads every file again. --settle leaves files changed less than MIN minutes
      ago. A model that is not on this machine is used only for a host named in
      semantic.privacy.cloudConsent, its API key comes from semantic.model.apiKey, the key of a
      text or vision model on the same host, or the environment variable MD_MEMO_EMBED_API_KEY,
      and a run that would send more than 1000 chunk texts needs --yes. JSON: {scrap_dir,
      index_dir, model, local, files, files_changed, files_removed, chunks, chunks_new,
      chunks_reused, embedded, seconds, ...}.

Output: text at a terminal, JSON when piped; --json / --text override. Exit 0 ok (no result is
not an error), 1 error.
`
	case "config":
		return `syki config get [<key.path>] [--json|--text]

Runs on its own (syki::sok need not be running). Shows config.json with every secret hidden, so it
is the safe way to look at the settings, also for an AI agent (never read config.json itself: it
holds API keys and tokens).

  config get                 The whole file.
  config get vision          One section (an object).
  config get scraps.scrapDir One value. Names are joined with dots; a number picks an array item.
                             An unknown name: "Error: no such key", exit 1.

Hidden: every string below a key whose name contains apikey, api_key, api-key, token, secret,
password or passwd (at any depth) is shown as "<set>" when it has a value and "<unset>" when it
is empty, with no part of the value; user:password@ in a URL is removed, and so are the values
of key=, token=, ... in a URL query. Numbers and true/false are shown as they are.
Output: JSON (an object or array is pretty-printed; a single value is JSON too when piped, or
bare with --text, which is what a script wants). Exit 0 ok, 1 error (also when config.json is
not valid JSON).
`
	case "lessons":
		return `syki lessons list [--agent <key>] [--json|--text]

Runs on its own (syki::sok need not be running), reads only, creates nothing. Shows the lessons kept
for agents: short rules a person approved after an agent's run failed. They live in one Markdown
file per agent, <settings folder>/lessons/<agent key>.md (syki info shows the settings folder),
and are put in front of that agent's instruction when it runs from a {{ }} task. Delete a line or
the file to take a rule away; "lessons: false" on the agent in agents.yaml keeps them from it.

  lessons list                  Every file of the lessons folder.
  lessons list --agent claude   One agent (its key or an alias); also when it has no file yet.

JSON: one object for --agent, a list of them without it ([] when the folder has no file):
{agent, path, exists, count, applied, skipped, disabled}. count is the rules in the file, applied
how many the next run is given (the newest, at most 30 and 4000 characters in all), skipped the
older ones left out for that, disabled "lessons: false" (then applied and skipped are 0).
There is no command that adds or changes a rule, on purpose: an agent could rewrite its own future
instructions with it. A person saves rules from the window, or edits the file.
Output: text at a terminal, JSON when piped; --json / --text override. Exit 0 ok, 1 error.
