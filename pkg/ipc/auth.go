// every method except the pure reads listed below: a request without it, or with a wrong one, gets
// ErrCodeUnauthorized and is not run. The reads keep the older rule (the token is optional and only
// a wrong one is refused).

// The set is a list of what is safe WITHOUT a token, not of what needs one, so a method added
// later is protected until someone deliberately puts it here.

// The legacy one-line messages ({"action":"pipe|open|activate"}, sent by `cmd | syki` and
// `syki <file>`) are a separate channel: they carry no token and are not affected.
