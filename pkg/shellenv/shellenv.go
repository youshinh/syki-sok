// Package shellenv recovers the PATH a macOS user actually has in their terminal.
//
// An app bundle launched from Finder, the Dock or Spotlight inherits launchd's environment,
// not the user's shell environment. That PATH is essentially
// "/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin", so every tool installed by Homebrew (/opt/homebrew/bin,
// /usr/local/bin), by pip/pipx (~/.local/bin) or behind a version-manager shim - git in some
// setups, and certainly jq, claude, codex, ollama, gh, node - is invisible to exec.LookPath.
// syki::sok then reports "not found" for the command bar, the AI CLI, Quick Actions, slot
// agents, git sync and CheckAgentAvailability, while the exact same command works fine when
// the user launches the app from a terminal.
//
// The fix is the standard one: ask the user's own login shell what its PATH is, and merge it
// into the process environment. Everything here except ResolveLoginShellPath and Apply is a
// pure function so the marker parsing and the merge rules can be unit-tested on any platform.
//
// The package is only ever used on macOS. It therefore hard-codes ":" as the PATH separator
// rather than using os.PathListSeparator, which keeps the pure functions deterministic when
// their tests run on Windows.
