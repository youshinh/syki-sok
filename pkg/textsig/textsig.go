// Package textsig gives a note's text a short fingerprint, so syki::sok can tell whether the file a tab was read from or last saved to
// still holds that text, without keeping a second copy of the text.
//
// frontend/js/disk_sync.js computes the SAME fingerprint (the shared vectors in both test files pin it): the page stores the
// fingerprint of the text a tab came from or was last saved as, and sends it with the next save; Go reads the file, fingerprints
// what is there now and compares. A mismatch means the file was changed by something else (another editor, a Git pull, a sync
// client, an agent) since this tab last knew it.
//
// Line endings do not count (a CRLF file and the same text as LF have one fingerprint: the page's editor works on LF), and the
// hash runs over UTF-16 code units, which is what the page's strings are made of. It is not a cryptographic hash: it only has to
// notice change, and 53 bits plus the length make an accidental match practically impossible.
