// This file holds the macOS platform functions that need no C.* call, split out of
// window_darwin.go so they - and the rest of this package - still type-check on a machine with
// no Objective-C toolchain: `GOOS=darwin GOARCH=arm64 CGO_ENABLED=0 go vet ./...` catches a
// pure-Go regression on Windows CI, without waiting for the macOS runner. window_darwin.go
// (`//go:build darwin && cgo`) keeps the functions that do call into Objective-C; the cgo-only
// symbols this file's callers still need (runPlatformWindow, activatePlatformWindow,
// updateGlobalHotKeyNative) get a stub in platform_darwin_nocgo.go for the !cgo build.

// trimProcessWorkingSet is a no-op on macOS: there is no EmptyWorkingSet equivalent, and the
// kernel reclaims pages from an idle process on its own. App.TrimMemory still runs
// debug.FreeOSMemory off the UI thread on this platform, which is the part that matters here.
//
// Because this is a no-op, the windowVisible flag that gates the delayed trim has no effect
// on macOS, so the Cocoa show/hide paths (applicationShouldHandleReopen / windowShouldClose,
// both implemented in Objective-C in window_darwin.go) deliberately do not call back into Go
// just to set it - that would mean exporting Go callbacks through cgo for no behavioural gain.

// closePlatformWindow implements App.CloseWindow for macOS. It is also how Cmd+Q, the Quit menu
// item and Dock > Quit end the app, once the page has saved its session (window_darwin.go's
// applicationShouldTerminate: reaches it through mdmemoGoQuit).
//
// It stops the Cocoa run loop rather than destroying the webview. webview's cocoa engine
// closes the NSWindow on Destroy but never terminates NSApp, so the old behaviour left the
// process alive with no window: applicationShouldHandleReopen had nothing to show, the Dock
// icon did nothing, and the HTTP server and IPC listener stayed bound to their ports.
//
// Terminating this way (rather than [NSApp terminate:nil]) lets webview_run return normally,
// so runPlatformWindow's deferred Destroy and main's deferred ipcServer.Close() /
// listener.Close() all still run - which is what removes ipc-session.json on exit.
